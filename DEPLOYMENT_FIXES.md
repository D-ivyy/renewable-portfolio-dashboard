# 🚀 Render Deployment Performance Fixes

## 🚨 Issues Identified from Your Logs

1. **Wrong Gunicorn Command**: Your logs show `gunicorn app:app` instead of `gunicorn app:server`
2. **Large Data Transfers**: 151KB responses causing slowdowns
3. **Too Many Callbacks**: Multiple component updates
4. **No Caching**: Data reprocessed on every interaction
5. **Single Worker**: Default sync worker not optimized

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Gunicorn Configuration
- ✅ Created `gunicorn.conf.py` with optimized settings
- ✅ Updated `render.yaml` to use the config file
- ✅ Added multiple workers for better concurrency

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Added caching to data loading functions (5-10 min cache)
- ✅ Reduced data sampling (5K max points instead of 10K)
- ✅ Limited forecast paths (10 instead of 30)
- ✅ Optimized callback functions

### 3. Memory Optimizations
- ✅ Aggressive data sampling for large datasets
- ✅ Cache cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- ✅ Reduced years of data processed

## 🔧 Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Redeploy with Correct Configuration

**Option A: Update via Render Dashboard**
1. Go to your Render service settings
2. Update the **Start Command** to: `gunicorn app:server --config gunicorn.conf.py`
3. Add environment variable: `WEB_CONCURRENCY = 2`
4. Redeploy

**Option B: Use Blueprint (Recommended)**
1. Push these changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Performance optimizations for Render"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. In Render Dashboard:
   - Delete current service
   - Create new service using "Blueprint"
   - Connect your repository (it will use render.yaml)

### Step 2: Monitor Performance

After redeployment, check:
- Response times should be under 2-3 seconds
- No more 151KB responses
- Fewer callback updates in logs
- More stable performance

## 🎯 Expected Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Response Size | 151KB | <20KB |
| Load Time | 10-15s | 2-4s |
| Memory Usage | High | Optimized |
| Cache Hits | 0% | 60-80% |
| Concurrent Users | 1 | 2-4 |

## 🔍 If Still Slow After Deployment

### Check 1: Verify Gunicorn Command
Look for this in logs: `Starting gunicorn` should show:
```
[INFO] Starting gunicorn 23.0.0
[INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:10000
[INFO] Using worker: sync
[INFO] Booting worker with pid: XXX (should see multiple workers)
```

### Check 2: Monitor Resource Usage
- CPU should be <50% average
- Memory should be <400MB
- Response times <3s

### Check 3: Data Loading
Logs should show:
```
📊 Found XXX parquet files in the directory
📋 Found X sites: ...
✅ Working in portfolio directory: ...
```

## 🆘 Emergency Performance Settings

If still having issues, add these to Render environment variables:

```
MAX_DATA_POINTS=2000
CACHE_TIMEOUT=600
WEB_CONCURRENCY=1
DASH_DEBUG=false
```

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

Watch for these in logs:
- ✅ Good: Response sizes <50KB
- ✅ Good: `POST /_dash-update-component` <2s
- ❌ Bad: Multiple restarts
- ❌ Bad: Large response sizes >100KB

## 🔧 Advanced Optimizations (If Needed)

### Option 1: Upgrade Render Plan
- Free tier: 512MB RAM, shared CPU
- Paid tier: More resources, dedicated CPU

### Option 2: Further Data Reduction
Edit these in `app.py`:
```python
MAX_DATA_POINTS = 1000  # Reduce further
path_cols[:5]  # Reduce to 5 paths
years_to_use[-2:]  # Use only 2 years
```

### Option 3: Add Redis Caching
For production, consider external caching with Redis.
